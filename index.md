YData: An Introduction to Data Science
====

YData aims to enhance students' knowledge and capabilities in the fundamental ideas and skills of data science.
Derived from Berkeley's popular [Data 8](http://data8.org) course, YData is an introduction to data science that emphasizes
computational and programming skills along with inferential thinking.

The course is designed to be accessible to students with little or no
background in computing, programming, or statistics. At the same time, 
it is meant to be engaging for more technically oriented students, through the extensive
use of examples and hands-on data analysis.  


Materials
---

Much of the content for the course is derived from [Data 8](http://data8.org),
which has made assignments, the textbook and other materials available online under a Creative Commons license.


**Textbook**: [Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data
Science](http://inferentialthinking.com) is a free online textbook that
includes interactive Jupyter notebooks and public data sets for all examples.
The textbook source is maintained as an [open source
project](https://github.com/data-8/textbook).


Computing
---

The course is based
on the Python programming language and a special-purpose cloud computing
platform. Exercises and assignments are presented as Jupyter notebooks, using a Python 3 installation
with the standard modules from [an Anaconda
installation](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) such as Numpy and Matplotlib,
as well as the Berkeley [datascience](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/datascience/) module.

But students are not required to know anything about the details of these installations
when using the Web-based computing platform provided by the course.

The course provides a hosted environment for students to edit and execute their
code. This ``levels the playing field'' with respect to prior computing and programming experience,
and makes it easy for students to get started. For the code cognoscenti, the platform 
is based on a [Kubernetes-based deployment of
JupyterHub](https://github.com/data-8/jupyterhub-k8s/blob/master/README.md) that
was developed at Berkeley.

YData: An Introduction to Data Science
====

YData aims to enhance students' knowledge and capabilities in the fundamental ideas and skills of data science.
Derived from Berkeley's popular [Data 8](http://data8.org) course, YData is an introduction to data science that emphasizes
computational and programming skills along with inferential thinking.

The course is designed to be accessible to students with little or no
background in computing, programming, or statistics. At the same time, 
it is meant to be engaging for more technically oriented students, through the extensive
use of examples and hands-on data analysis.  


Materials
---

Much of the content for the course is derived from [Data 8](http://data8.org),
which has made assignments, the textbook and other materials available online under a Creative Commons license.

The course is based
on the Python programming language and a special-purpose cloud computing
platform. Exercises are available as Jupyter notebooks, using a Python 3 installation
with the standard modules from [an Anaconda
installation](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) such as Numpy and Matplotlib,
as well as the Berkeley [datascience](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/datascience/) module.
But students are not required to know anything about the details of these installations
when using the Web-based computing platform provided by the course.

We provide a hosted environment for our students to edit and execute their
Notebooks. It includes two components, a [Kubernetes-based deployment of
JupyterHub](https://github.com/data-8/jupyterhub-k8s/blob/master/README.md) that
we have specifically designed for courses, and an [assignment
server](https://github.com/data-8/nbinteract) that loads assignments into the
students' environment.


**Textbook**: [Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data
Science](http://inferentialthinking.com) is a free online textbook that
includes interactive Jupyter notebooks and public data sets for all examples.
The textbook source is maintained as an [open source
project](https://github.com/data-8/textbook).

**Lecture Materials**: All [lecture videos from Fall
2016](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFeJ2hV8Fyt7mjvwrDQ2QNYEYdtKSNA0y)
are hosted by Youtube. Slides as [PDF from Fall 2016](./fa16) and [Google Slides
and Jupyter notebooks from Spring 2017](./sp17) are linked from the respective
course calendars. To request access to the source of the slides for
instructional purposes, please fill out our [Data 8 Instructor

    "Decomposing Python into small parts is kind of like diagramming an English sentence.  While our brains are perfectly capable of generating and understanding English without explicitly identifying things like subjects and predicates, Python interprets code very literally according to its rules (its *syntax*).  So if you want to understand Python code, it's more important to have a precise model of Python's rules in your head.  On the flip side, Python's rules are much simpler than those of English (see, for example, [this amusingly complicated English sentence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo)) -- they just seem complicated because we're less familiar with them.\n",

    "Line 0 above is just an expression: `3`.  Like many (but not all) expressions, it has a value, the integer 3.  Like some (but not all) expressions, computing its value causes nothing to \"happen\" to the world.  (We say it has no *side effects*.)  When Python executes line 0, it computes that value.  Since nothing is done with it, it just gets discarded.  The same is true of lines 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13, and 16 -- those are expression statements that cause values to be computed, but the computation has no side effects, and the value of the full expression is eventually discarded.  Line 14 is an expression that does have side effects -- it causes the `'Things'` column in the table named `t` to be renamed to `'Nonsense'`.  The other lines are statements but not expressions, but we will see that, like many statements, they *contain* expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions are themselves usually made up of several smaller expressions joined together by some rules; we call these *compound expressions*, and we sometimes call the component expressions *subexpressions*.  Line 2, for example, is a compound expression made up of the subexpressions `4` and `3` joined by `+`.  Python knows what a `+` between two expressions means, and it puts them together so that the value of `4+3` is the value of `4` plus the value of `3`, or 7.\n",

But `(2+3)` is itself a compound expression, made up of `2` and `3` joined by `+`.  Python first computes the value of `(2+3)`, which is 5, and then computes the value of `z`, which is 3 (`z` having been assigned previously), and then adds 5 and 3 to get 8.  `(2+3)*(4*((5*6)+7))` is also a valid expression.

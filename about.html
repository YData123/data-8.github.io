<p>This introductory course in data science is built on three interrelated
perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world
relevance.  Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one
analyze that data so as to understand that phenomenon?  How does one collect
data to answer questions that one is interested in?  Inferential thinking
refers to an ability to connect data to underlying phenomena and to the ability
to think critically about the conclusions that are drawn from data analysis.
Computational thinking refers to the ability to conceive of the abstractions
and processes that allow inferential procedures to be embodied in computer
programs, and to ensure that such programs are scalable, robust and
understandable.  In addition to teaching basic skills in computer programming
and statistical inference, the course will also involve the hands-on analysis
of a variety of real-world datasets, including economic data, document
collections, geographical data and social networks, and it will delve into
social and legal issues surrounding data analysis, including issues of privacy
and data ownership.</p>


<h2 id="course-format">Course Format</h2>


<p>The course includes many events: lecture, lab, office hours, and review sessions. Weekly lab sections are typically the most valuable events to attend. For the rest, your attendance is optional. These events exist to help you learn, and so you are advised to attend as many as required to master the material.</p>

<p><strong>Lecture</strong>: The course includes three 50-minute lectures per week. Lecture videos might be distributed online (TBD).</p>

<p><strong>Lab</strong>: The course includes one laboratory section each week. These sections are run by an amazing group of Teaching Assistants who have been carefully selected for their ability, enthusiasm, and dedication to learning. Getting to know your TA is an excellent way to succeed in this course.</p>

<p>If you wish to switch sections, simply start attending the section you wish to join. You do not need to update your section on TeleBEARS. Seating priority will be given to people who are officially enrolled in a section, but we will all do our best to accommodate your wishes.</p>

<p>It's best to find a permanent section as soon as you can and in the first week. Course projects are completed in pairs. We strongly encourage you to find a partner in your own section. Your TA will help you.</p>

<p>Participation in lab and discussion is tracked but not required. See the section on grading for more details.</p>

<p><strong>Office Hours</strong>: Attending office hours is another excellent way to succeed in this course. Office hours are held by TAs and the instructor each week. A schedule appears on the staff page of the course website.</p>

<p>In office hours, you can ask questions about the material, receive guidance on assignments, work with peers and course staff in a small group setting, find project partners, and learn about computer science at Berkeley.</p>
